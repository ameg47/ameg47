<h1>Hey there! 👋</h1>

I'm Agustin Ecker, International Business graduate and full stack web developer student 👨🏻‍💻. As a problem solver and logical thinker I like facing and finding solutions to the problems that programming throws at you. I´m always eager to learn new things and get the chance to master new technologies 👀
